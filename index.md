Firstly, FI module divided into parts such as General Ledger, Account Receivable, Account Payable, and Asset Accounting. These are the main 4 parts of FI. There are other parts that can be included into FI consultant work environment such as TRM (Treasury and Risk Management, CM (Cash Management), FSCM(Financial Supply Chain Management) and some more. 

There will be main topics in the blog, Configuration articles, FI Screens and how to use, important Tcodes, descriptions( like a dictionary).

Some post will be in English and Turkish (which is my mother thong). I will explain special processes that Turkey has only in Turkish but other ones will be explained in both language.

Enjoy and don't forget that All knowledge is connected to all other knowledge. The fun is in making the connections.
